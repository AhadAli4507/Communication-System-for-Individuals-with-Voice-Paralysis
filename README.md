# Communication System for Individuals with Voice Paralysis

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a communication system for individuals with voice paralysis, utilizing neuro link chip technology. The system aims to enable effective communication by translating neural signals into commands or messages that can be conveyed through a computer or other communication interfaces. This technology has the potential to provide a means for paralyzed individuals to express their thoughts, desires, and emotions, enhancing their ability to interact with the outside world.
